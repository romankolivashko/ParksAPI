* On Windows 10 x64 or later
  * [Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) to download the 64-bit .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp for Windows.

#### Install dotnet script
 Enter the command ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`` in Terminal for macOS or PowerShell for Windows.

#### Install MySQL Workbench
 [Download and install the appropriate version of MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

#### Install Postman
(Optional) [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

#### Code Editor

  To view or edit the code, you will need an code editor or text editor. The popular open-source choices for an code editor are Atom and VisualStudio Code.

  1) Code Editor Download:
     * Option 1: [Atom](https://nodejs.org/en/)
     * Option 2: [VisualStudio Code](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  2) Click the download most applicable to your OS and system.
  3) Wait for download to complete, then install -- Windows will run the setup exe and macOS will drag and drop into applications.
  4) Optionally, create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Use

  #### Cloning

  1) Navigate to the [Parks API repository here](https://github.com/romankolivashko/ParksAPI.git).
  2) Click 'Clone or download' to reveal the HTTPS url ending with .git and the 'Download ZIP' option.
  3) Open up your system Terminal or GitBash, navigate to your desktop with the command: `cd Desktop`, or whichever location suits you best.
  4) Clone the repository to your desktop: `$ git clone https://github.com/romankolivashko/ParksAPI.git`
  5) Run the command `cd ParksApi.Solution` to enter into the project directory.
  6) View or Edit:
      * Code Editor - Run the command `atom .` or `code .` to open the project in Atom or VisualStudio Code respectively for review and editing.
      * Text Editor - Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.

  #### Download

  1) Navigate to the [Parks API repository here](https://github.com/romankolivashko/ParksAPI).
  2) Click 'Clone or download' to reveal the HTTPS url ending with .git and the 'Download ZIP' option.
  3) Click 'Download ZIP' and unextract.
  4) Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.

  #### AppSettings

  1) Create a new file in the ParksApi.Solution/ParksApi directory named `appsettings.json`
  2) Add in the following code snippet to the new appsettings.json file:
  
  ```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=parks;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
    }
}
  ```
  3) Change the server, port, and user id as necessary. Replace 'YourPassword' with relevant MySQL password (set at installation of MySQL).

  #### Database
  1) Navigate to ParksApi.Solution/ParksApi directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell (e.g. `cd Desktop/ParksApi.Solution/ParksApi`).
  2) Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
  3) (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update. After, run the previous command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database.

  #### Launch the API
  1) Navigate to ParksApi.Solution/ParksApi directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell (e.g. `cd Desktop/ParksApi.Solution/ParksApi`).
  2) Run the command `dotnet run` to have access to the API in Postman or browser.

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Documentation
Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser. You will not be able to utilize authentication in a browser.

### Using Swagger Documentation 
To explore the ParksApi.Solution API with NSwag, launch the project using `dotnet run` with the Terminal or Powershell, and input the following URL into your browser: `https://localhost:5000/`

### Note:
Swagger will redirect to `https://localhost:5000/index.html` providing API documentation


..........................................................................................

### Endpoints
Base URL: `https://localhost:5000`

#### HTTP Request Structure
```
GET /api/{component}
POST /api/{component}
GET /api/{component}/{id}
PUT /api/{component}/{id}
DELETE /api/{component}/{id}
```

#### Versioning Example Query, here version 1 is called
```
https://localhost:5000/api/parks/2?api-version=1.0
```

#### Sample JSON Response
```
{
joinEntities: [ ],
parkId: 2,

```
https://localhost:5000/api/parks/2?api-version=2.0
```

#### Sample JSON Response
```
Api Key was not provided
```
Note: version 1.0 is set to be default, to be able to call version 2, make sure to create ApiKey object  in `appsettings.json` file, then use that key upon API call (Postman --> Authorisation --> Type: API Key --> Value: yourKey ), here is example of `appsetting.json` file with ApiKey.
```
{ 
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
